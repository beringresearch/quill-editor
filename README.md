# Quill

[Quill](quilleditor.com) is a writerâ€™s tool that was designed to help you focus on your work through a clean, simple, and effective user interface. Quill foregoes the bells and whistles of heavy-duty writing programmes in favour of just letting you write.

Quill is a commercial software, but is offered for free during Beta Testing.

> What is **Beta Testing**? This means that the core functionality of Quill has been developed, but there still may be some bugs that will need to be squashed. The purpose of a Beta test is to release Quill free of charge to a small group of writers and gather feedback.

This repository was created to foster a community that enables a free discussion of bugs, issues, as well as future direction for this project.
