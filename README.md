# Quill

[Quill](quilleditor.com) is a writerâ€™s tool that allows you to experience your stories. It was designed to help you focus on your work through a clean, simple, and effective user interface.

Quill is a commercial software, but is offered for free during Beta testing. This repository was created to foster a community of writers and enable our users to freely discuss bugs, issues, and influence future direction of this project.
