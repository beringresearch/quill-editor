# Quill

[Quill](quilleditor.com) is a writerâ€™s tool that was designed to help you focus on your work through a clean, simple, and effective user interface. Quill foregoes the bells and whistles of heavy-duty writing programmes if favour of just letting you write.

Quill is a commercial software, but is offered for free during Beta Testing.

> What is **Beta Testing**? This means that Quill has all the required functionality and features, but there still may be some bugs that will need to be squashed. The purpose of a Beta test is to release Quill free of charge to a small group of writers and gather feedback.

This repository was created to foster a community of writers and enable our users to freely discuss bugs, issues, and influence future direction of this project.
